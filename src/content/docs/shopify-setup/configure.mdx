## Signup as Shopify partner
Start by signing up as a <a href="https://www.shopify.com/se/partners" target="_blank">Shopify Partner</a>. This gives you access to create and manage development stores without needing a paid plan. Once your store is ready, you can easily transition it to a live environment.

3. Select **Create a store for a client** and fill in the rest of the information

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">As a **Shopify Partner**, you can earn an additional **20%** in recurring revenue as an affiliate when you transfer a development store to a clientâ€”calculated based on their selected plan.</Aside>

Now your development store is ready to use.
